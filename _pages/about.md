I am a Research Master's student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Duke University, specializing in machine learning. My academic focus revolves around the privacy and reliability of AI.

Previously, I worked as a research engineer at the NCAI Center, where I was involved in building ML systems for various applications. I also interned at the EMAN Group at KAUST, working on enhancing biomedical signal classification. I obtained my B.Sc. from King Saud University, majoring in Electrical Engineering.
